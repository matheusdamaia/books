                <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                        <p>Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some <span>very positive</span> results with these headlines as well.

                        They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our collection of   <span>200 headlines</span> with everyone.
